# What are EVMOS EVM Extensions?
See https://github.com/evmos/extensions

Evmos’ unique implementation of stateful precompiles are called EVM Extensions. For the first time, this will allow not only blockchains but also individual applications to leverage and customize the functionality of IBC and other Cosmos SDK modules. Thus, these extensions push the EVM’s capabilities past its original specification without breaking equivalence with Ethereum’s execution layer. With the use of EVM Extensions, developers will be able to create their own business logic for connecting with other smart contracts and app chains in the Cosmos ecosystem. Applications will be freed from the confines of a single blockchain and able to make smart contract calls to IBC modules to communicate with other chains, send and receive assets between chains trustlessly, stake EVMOS tokens, and even manage accounts on other blockchains to access any functionality built elsewhere.
